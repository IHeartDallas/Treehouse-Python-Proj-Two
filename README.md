Python Dictionary/List manipulation 

This project illustrates how Python can be used to import data and eventually manipulate that data.   In this case, we import a list containing dictionaries(key/value pairs).   Basic methods are used to work with the dictionaryies.  In turn the methods are used in functions that sift through the data to create three balanced teams based on: 1) same number of players, 2)novice/advanced players, and 3)Average height of the players.
